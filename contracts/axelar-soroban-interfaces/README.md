# Axelar Soroban Interfaces

This crate contains the interfaces for the Axelar Soroban contracts. This allows for contracts to depend on each other without creating conflicts such as duplicate names. Applications should import this crate to integrate with Axelar (such as implement AxelarExecutable).
